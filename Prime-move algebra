Abstract

We present a step‑by‑step derivation of the golden ratio \phi as the fixed point of the infinite Prime Move loop. The loop is modeled by the recurrence x_{n+1}=1+1/x_n, whose limit is the positive root of x^2-x-1=0. Elementary algebra and dynamical‑systems analysis show that \phi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2 emerges inevitably from this recursion, illustrating the deterministic “macro” trajectory of the Prime Move. The derivation is self‑contained and accessible to readers with high‑school algebra.

1. The Infinite Prime Move as a Recurrence

In the infinite mode of the Prime Move, each cycle leaves a residue that becomes the starting point of the next cycle. For the golden‑triangle geometry, this process is captured by the map

f(x)=1+\frac{1}{x},\qquad x>0. \tag{1}

If x_n denotes the state after n cycles, then

x_{n+1}=f(x_n)=1+\frac{1}{x_n}. \tag{2}

The term “1” represents the split that always adds a unit; the term “1/x_n” is the scar—the residual fraction carried forward.

2. Fixed‑Point Condition

If the iteration converges, then for large n,

x_{n+1}\approx x_n \equiv x .

Substituting this into (2) gives the fixed‑point equation

x = 1 + \frac{1}{x}. \tag{3}

3. Algebraic Solution

Multiply (3) by x (assuming x\neq 0):

x^2 = x + 1 .

Rearrange into standard quadratic form:

x^2 - x - 1 = 0 . \tag{4}

Apply the quadratic formula x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} with a=1,\;b=-1,\;c=-1:

x = \frac{-(-1)\pm\sqrt{(-1)^2-4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)}
= \frac{1\pm\sqrt{1+4}}{2}
= \frac{1\pm\sqrt{5}}{2}. \tag{5}

4. Selecting the Physical Root

Equation (5) yields two real solutions:

x_1 = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx 1.6180339887,\qquad
x_2 = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx -0.6180339887 .

Because the recurrence describes a ratio of lengths (or a scaling factor), only the positive solution is physically meaningful. Denoting this solution by \phi, we obtain

\boxed{\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}. \tag{6}

The negative solution equals -\phi^{-1} and is irrelevant for the geometric construction.

5. Convergence Analysis

To verify that iteration (2) actually approaches \phi, examine the derivative of f:

f'(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2}.

At the fixed point,

|f'(\phi)| = \frac{1}{\phi^2} \approx 0.381966 < 1 .

Since |f'(\phi)|<1, the fixed point is attracting; for any starting value x_0>0, the sequence \{x_n\} converges to \phi. This guarantees that the infinite Prime Move, once initiated, inevitably tends toward the golden ratio.

6. Geometric Interpretation

In the golden triangle (angles 72^\circ,72^\circ,36^\circ), bisecting a 72^\circ angle produces a smaller similar triangle whose side‑length ratio is exactly 1/\phi. Repeated bisection generates the continued‑fraction expansion

\phi = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1+\cfrac{1}{1+\cfrac{1}{1+\cdots}}},

which is precisely the limit of iteration (2). Thus the algebraic fixed point corresponds to the self‑similar nesting of golden triangles.

7. Connection to the Full Prime Move Loop

The five‑step Prime Move loop (Split, Tension, Failed Merge, Scar, Decay) reduces to the map f(x)=1+1/x when:

· Split introduces the “+1”,
· Scar contributes the “1/x_n” residue,
· Decay is neglected (infinite‑mode idealization),
· Tension and Failed Merge are absorbed in the functional form.

Hence the derivation above captures the infinite, lossless limit of the Prime Move, where each cycle’s output becomes the next cycle’s input without degradation.

8. Conclusion

The golden ratio \phi emerges as the unique positive fixed point of the recurrence x_{n+1}=1+1/x_n. This algebraic result is rigorous and independent of any computational simulation. It demonstrates that the infinite Prime Move possesses a deterministic macro‑trajectory converging to \phi, providing a mathematical foundation for the observed prevalence of the golden ratio in recursive geometric processes.
