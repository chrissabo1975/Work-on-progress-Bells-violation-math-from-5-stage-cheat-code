# Prime Move Theory - Mathematical Core

**Work in progress: First formalization of 5-stage constitutive loop 
that generates golden ratio φ from recursive "failed merges" and reproduces 
standard QM Bell violations.**

## Key Results (verified numerically):
- Infinite prime move → φ = (1+√5)/2 fixed point [derivation]
- 2-qubit simulation → CHSH max 2√2 ≈ 2.828 [code runs]
- Parameter sweeps across 2400 points [dataset included]

## Status
v0.1 - Initial math + QM validation. Actively seeking collaborators/critics.
